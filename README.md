The rising potential of this comparatively under-the-radar market fuels the need for an ML-based solution to develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices. They want you to analyze the data provided and build a linear regression model to predict the price of a used phone/tablet and identify factors that significantly influence it.
Refurbished and used devices continue to provide cost-effective alternatives to both consumers and businesses that are looking to save money when purchasing one. There are plenty of other benefits associated with the used device market. Used and refurbished devices can be sold with warranties and can also be insured with proof of purchase. Third-party vendors/platforms, such as Verizon, Amazon, etc., provide attractive offers to customers for refurbished devices. Maximizing the longevity of devices through second-hand trade also reduces their environmental impact and helps in recycling and reducing waste. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak may further boost this segment as consumers cut back on discretionary spending and buy phones and tablets only for immediate needs.
